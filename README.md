# Pencil Backend Assessment

The goal of this assignment is to store and create an index over question objects in **MongoDB**, and write a **NodeJS + Express** based server that exposes a RESTful API to query the index and return questions that match the query.
 
Each question will be annotated with one or more annotations. An annotation is defined as a topic that can come from a topic tree.

The application is hosted using Heroku and you can try it out using the following link:

## Database Schema

For each topic in the topic tree, the database stores the following information:

 - **_id**: Topic name (Unique)
 - **children**: Immediate children/subtopics of the topic
 - **subtopics**: All the subtopics that come under the topic
 - **questions**: All the question numbers which have at least one of the subtopics in their annotation
